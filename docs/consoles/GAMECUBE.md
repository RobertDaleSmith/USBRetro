3. Press **D-Pad Down** to cycle backward
4. Controller rumbles and LED flashes to confirm
5. Profile saves to flash memory (persists across power cycles)

### Keyboard Mode

Use a USB keyboard as a GameCube keyboard:

- Press **Scroll Lock** or **F14** to toggle keyboard mode
- LED indicator shows when active
- All standard keys mapped to GameCube keyboard protocol
- Works with Phantasy Star Online and other keyboard-compatible games

### Copilot Mode

Combine multiple USB controllers into a single GameCube controller:

- Connect multiple controllers to USB hub
- All inputs merge into one controller output
- Perfect for accessibility or assisted gameplay
- Each player can control different buttons simultaneously

### Rumble Support

Full rumble/vibration feedback for compatible controllers:
- Xbox controllers (all generations)
- PlayStation DualShock 3/4/5
- Switch Pro Controller
- 8BitDo controllers with rumble

### Adaptive Triggers (DualSense)

DualSense controllers can use adaptive trigger threshold:
- L2/R2 analog values mapped to GameCube L/R
- Configurable threshold per profile

## Button Mappings

### Default Profile

Standard mapping for most games:

| USB Input | GameCube Output |
|-----------|-----------------|
| B1 (Cross/B) | B |
| B2 (Circle/A) | A |
| B3 (Square/X) | Y |
| B4 (Triangle/Y) | X |
| L1 (LB/L) | - (disabled) |
| R1 (RB/R) | Z |
| L2 (LT/ZL) | L (analog) |
| R2 (RT/ZR) | R (analog) |
| S1 (Select) | - (profile switch) |
| S2 (Start) | Start |
| D-Pad | D-Pad |
| Left Stick | Control Stick |
| Right Stick | C-Stick |

### SNES Profile

For SNES-style controllers (L/R as full press):

| USB Input | GameCube Output |
|-----------|-----------------|
| L1 (LB) | L (digital + full analog) |
| R1 (RB) | R (digital + full analog) |
| S1 (Select) | Z |
| Other | Same as Default |

### SSBM Profile

Super Smash Bros. Melee competitive mapping:

| USB Input | GameCube Output | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| B1 (Cross/B) | B | Attack |
| B2 (Circle/A) | A | Jump |
| B3 (Square/X) | Y | Jump |
| B4 (Triangle/Y) | X | Jump |
| L1 (LB) | Z | Grab |
| R1 (RB) | X | Short hop aerial |
| L2 (LT @ 88%) | L (17% analog) | Light shield |
| R2 (RT @ 55%) | L+R | Quit combo |
| Left Stick | 85% sensitivity | Precision movement |

**Key Features:**
- Light shield at 17% on L trigger
- Quick quit combo (L+R+Start) on RT
- Multiple jump buttons (A, X, Y, RB)
- 85% stick sensitivity for precise movement

### MKWii Profile

Mario Kart Wii optimized:

| USB Input | GameCube Output | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| L1 (LB) | D-Up | Wheelies/tricks |
| R1 (RB) | R (full analog) | Drift |
| R2 (RT) | Z (instant) | Item throw |
| Other | Same as Default | |

### Fighting Profile

2D fighting game layout:

| USB Input | GameCube Output | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| L1 (LB) | C-Up | Macro input |
| R1 (RB) | Z | |
| Right Stick | Disabled | Prevents accidental input |
| Other | Same as Default | |

## Hardware Requirements

- **Board**: Adafruit KB2040 (default), Pico, QT Py, Waveshare
- **Clock**: 130MHz (overclocked for joybus timing)
- **Protocol**: GameCube joybus via PIO
- **Connector**: GameCube controller cable

### GameCube Controller Cable Pinout

```
Pin 1: VCC (5V)
Pin 2: Data (bidirectional)
Pin 3: GND
Pin 4: GND
Pin 6: 3.3V (optional, some boards)
```

**Connection:**
- Data pin → RP2040 GPIO (configurable)
- Share ground with RP2040
- 5V for power

## Technical Details

### Profile Persistence

- Uses last 4KB of flash memory
- Debounced 5 seconds after profile change (reduces wear)
- Approximately 100K write cycles available
- Survives firmware updates (by design)

### Dual-Core Architecture

- **Core 0**: USB polling, input processing, main loop
- **Core 1**: Joybus protocol (timing-critical)

### Joybus Protocol

- 130MHz clock required for timing accuracy
- Bidirectional single-wire protocol
- ~6μs bit period
- Uses joybus-pio library

## Troubleshooting

**Controller not detected:**
- Check GameCube cable connections
- Verify 3.3V power and ground pins
- Check data pin assignment in firmware

**Rumble not working:**
- Only compatible controllers support rumble
- Check USB power supply (rumble requires more current)
- Use powered USB hub for multiple controllers

**Profile not saving:**
- Wait 5 seconds after profile change for flash write
- Check that flash memory isn't corrupted
- Reflash firmware if needed

**Keyboard mode not activating:**
- Press Scroll Lock or F14 key
- Check LED indicator
- Some keyboards may not be compatible

**Stick drift or incorrect calibration:**
- GameCube expects centered at 128
- USB controllers are auto-calibrated
- Check for physical stick drift
