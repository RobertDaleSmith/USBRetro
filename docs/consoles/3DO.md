## Hardware Requirements

- **Board**: Adafruit KB2040 (default), Waveshare RP2040-Zero
- **Protocol**: PBUS serial via PIO state machines
- **GPIO Pins**:
  - CLK (Pin 2) - Clock input from 3DO
  - DATA_OUT (Pin 3) - Data output to 3DO
  - DATA_IN (Pin 4) - Data input from next controller
  - CS_CTRL (Pin 5) - Chip select / control

### 3DO Controller Port Pinout

```
Pin 1: Clock (CLK)
Pin 2: Data Out (to console)
Pin 3: Data In (from next controller)
Pin 4: Audio Left (unused)
Pin 5: Audio Right (unused)
Pin 6: VCC (5V)
Pin 7: GND
Pin 8: Control Select
```

## 3DO PBUS Protocol

The 3DO uses a serial PBUS (Peripheral Bus) protocol:
- Clock-synchronized serial communication
- Bidirectional data lines
- Daisy chain architecture (up to 8 devices)
- Different report sizes per device type:
  - Joypad: 2 bytes (16 bits)
  - Joystick: 9 bytes (72 bits)
  - Mouse: 4 bytes (32 bits)

## Compatible 3DO Consoles

- Panasonic FZ-1 / FZ-10
- Goldstar GDO-101M / GDO-202M
- Sanyo TRY 3DO
- Creative Labs 3DO Blaster (PC card)

## Compatible Games

### Standard Controller:
- Road Rash
- Need for Speed
- Gex
- Crash 'n Burn
- Star Control II
- Return Fire

### Fighting Games:
- Way of the Warrior
- Super Street Fighter II Turbo

### Shooters:
- Doom
- PO'ed
- Killing Time

### Mouse-Compatible:
- Myst
- The Horde
- Lemmings

## Troubleshooting

**Controller not detected:**
- Check PBUS cable connections
- Verify 5V power supply
- Check CLK and DATA pin assignments
- Try reconnecting USB controller

**Multiple players not working:**
- Verify USB hub is powered
- Check total device count (max 8)
- Try connecting one controller at a time

**Extension passthrough not working:**
- Check DATA_IN connection
- Verify daisy chain wiring
- Native controller must be at end of chain

**Mouse not working:**
- Verify game supports 3DO mouse
- Check mouse is detected via USB
- Try different USB mouse

## Special Notes

- PBUS protocol uses PIO state machines for precise timing
- Extension passthrough allows mixing USB and native controllers
- Profile changes saved to flash (persists across power cycles)
- Based on [USBTo3DO](https://github.com/FCare/USBTo3DO) by FCare
