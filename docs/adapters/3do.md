# 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Adapter

USB controller adapter for 3DO with 8-player support and extension passthrough.

## Features

### Multi-Player Support (Up to 8 Players)

Full 8-player support via 3DO's PBUS daisy chain protocol:
- Connect up to 8 USB controllers via USB hub
- Each controller maps to a PBUS slot
- Automatic player assignment on connection
- Players shift on disconnect (SHIFT mode)

### Controller Types

**Joypad** (Standard Controller):
- D-pad, A, B, C buttons
- L, R shoulder buttons
- X (Stop), P (Play/Pause)

**Joystick** (Flight Stick):
- 4-axis analog support
- Digital buttons
- Full 3DO flight stick protocol

**Mouse**:
- USB mouse → 3DO mouse emulation
- Native 3DO mouse protocol
- Works with mouse-compatible games

### Extension Passthrough

Native 3DO controllers can be connected in series:
- USB controllers appear first in chain
- Native 3DO controllers pass through
- Full daisy chain support

### Button Profiles

Switch between optimized button mappings:

**Switching profiles:**

1. Press **SELECT + D-Pad Up** (previous profile) or **SELECT + D-Pad Down** (next) — both buttons
   together, not one after the other
2. Keep them held for about **0.7 s**; a quick tap passes straight through to the game
3. LED flashes and the controller rumbles to confirm
4. The selection stops at the first and last profile — it does not wrap around
5. Profile saves to flash (persists across power cycles)

## Hardware Requirements

- **Board**: Waveshare RP2040-Zero
- **Protocol**: PBUS serial via PIO state machines
- **Level Shifters**: Bidirectional 3.3V↔5V level shifter required
  - RP2040 GPIO is 3.3V and NOT 5V tolerant
  - All signal lines (CLK, DATA_OUT, DATA_IN, CS_CTRL) need shifting
  - Recommended: [4-channel BSS138 bidirectional level shifter](https://aliexpress.com/item/32771873030.html) (per FCare's design)

### Wiring Diagram

| RP2040-Zero | BD-LCC (Low) | BD-LCC (High) | DB9-Female | DB9-Male |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 5V | - | HV | - | - |
| GND | G | G | - | - |
| GPIO 2 | L1 | H1 | Pin 1 | Pin 1 |
| GPIO 3 | L2 | H2 | Pin 2 | Pin 2 |
| GPIO 4 | LV | HV | - | - |
| GPIO 5 | G | G | Pin 6 | Pin 6 |
| GPIO 6 | L3 | H3 | Pin 3 | Pin 3 |
| GPIO 7 | L4 | H4 | Pin 4 | Pin 4 |
| - | - | - | Pin 5 (5V) | Pin 5 |
| - | - | - | Pin 9 (GND) | Pin 9 |

- **DB9-Female**: Connects to 3DO console
- **DB9-Male**: Passthrough for daisy-chaining native controllers

### 3DO Controller Port Pinout

```
Pin 1: Clock (CLK)
Pin 2: Data Out (to console)
Pin 3: Data In (from next controller)
Pin 4: Audio Left (unused)
Pin 5: Audio Right (unused)
Pin 6: VCC (5V)
Pin 7: GND
Pin 8: Control Select
```

## 3DO PBUS Protocol

The 3DO uses a serial PBUS (Peripheral Bus) protocol:
- Clock-synchronized serial communication
- Bidirectional data lines
- Daisy chain architecture (up to 8 devices)
- Different report sizes per device type:
  - Joypad: 2 bytes (16 bits)
  - Joystick: 9 bytes (72 bits)
  - Mouse: 4 bytes (32 bits)

## Compatible 3DO Consoles

- Panasonic FZ-1 / FZ-10
- Goldstar GDO-101M / GDO-202M
- Sanyo TRY 3DO
- Creative Labs 3DO Blaster (PC card)

## Compatible Games

### Standard Controller:
- Road Rash
- Need for Speed
- Gex
- Crash 'n Burn
- Star Control II
- Return Fire

### Fighting Games:
- Way of the Warrior
- Super Street Fighter II Turbo

### Shooters:
- Doom
- PO'ed
- Killing Time

### Mouse-Compatible:
- Myst
- The Horde
- Lemmings

## Troubleshooting

**Controller not detected:**
- Check PBUS cable connections
- Verify 5V power supply
- Check CLK and DATA pin assignments
- Try reconnecting USB controller

**Multiple players not working:**
- Verify USB hub is powered
- Check total device count (max 8)
- Try connecting one controller at a time

**Extension passthrough not working:**
- Check DATA_IN connection
- Verify daisy chain wiring
- Native controller must be at end of chain

**Mouse not working:**
- Verify game supports 3DO mouse
- Check mouse is detected via USB
- Try different USB mouse

## Special Notes

- PBUS protocol uses PIO state machines for precise timing
- Extension passthrough allows mixing USB and native controllers
- Profile changes saved to flash (persists across power cycles)
- Based on [USBTo3DO](https://github.com/FCare/USBTo3DO) by FCare
