# usb23do

USB/BT controllers to 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.

## Overview

Connects USB and Bluetooth controllers to a 3DO console via the PBUS daisy-chain protocol. Supports up to 8 players, USB mouse as a 3DO mouse, extension passthrough for native 3DO controllers, and multiple button mapping profiles. Requires a bidirectional 3.3V-to-5V level shifter.

## Input

- [USB HID](../input/usb-hid.md), [XInput](../input/xinput.md), [Bluetooth](../input/bluetooth.md) controllers
- USB mouse (3DO mouse emulation)

## Output

[3DO Output](../output/3do.md) -- PBUS serial PIO protocol with daisy-chain support.

## Core Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Routing mode | SIMPLE (1:1 controller to PBUS slot) |
| Player slots | 8 (shift on disconnect) |
| Max USB devices | 8 |
| Profile system | 3 profiles |

## Profiles

Press **SELECT + D-Pad Up** (previous profile) or **SELECT + D-Pad Down** (next) together and hold for about **0.7 s** — pressing them one after the other does nothing, and a quick tap passes through to the game. The selection stops at the ends rather than wrapping.

| Profile | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default** | SNES-style layout (B1=B, B2=C, B3=A) |
| **Fighting** | Way of the Warrior, SFII (face buttons = punches, shoulders = kicks) |
| **Shooter** | Doom, PO'ed (shoulders = fire, face = movement actions) |

See the [Profiles (Detailed)](#profiles-detailed) section below for full button mapping tables per profile.

## Key Features

- **8-player support** -- Up to 8 USB controllers via USB hub, each mapped to a PBUS slot.
- **Extension passthrough** -- Native 3DO controllers connect in series after the USB adapter.
- **Mouse support** -- USB mouse emulates 3DO mouse for Myst, The Horde, Lemmings.
- **Device types** -- Joypad (2-byte), Joystick (9-byte), and Mouse (4-byte) PBUS reports.

## Troubleshooting

**Controller not detected:**
- Check PBUS cable connections, especially 5V power.
- Verify CLK and DATA pin assignments.
- Ensure the level shifter is wired correctly (all signal lines need 3.3V-to-5V shifting).

**Multiple players not working:**
- Verify the USB hub is powered.
- Check total device count (max 8).
- Try connecting one controller at a time.

**Extension passthrough not working:**
- Check the DATA_IN connection for the daisy chain.
- The native 3DO controller must be at the end of the chain.

**Mouse not working:**
- Verify the game supports the 3DO mouse.
- Check that the USB mouse is detected.
- Try a different USB mouse model.
