# ESP32-S3 Support

Joypad OS supports ESP32-S3 as a build target for the **BT2USB** app. The ESP32-S3 has both BLE and USB OTG, making it a compact standalone BLE-to-USB HID gamepad adapter.

## Overview

| Feature | Pico W / Pico 2 W | ESP32-S3 |
|---|---|---|
| Bluetooth | Classic BT + BLE | BLE only |
| USB Output | USB Device (RP2040) | USB OTG Device |
| Controllers | All BT controllers | BLE controllers only |
| Build System | pico-sdk / CMake | ESP-IDF / CMake |
| Firmware Update | Drag-and-drop (.uf2) | Drag-and-drop (.uf2) via TinyUF2 |

**BLE-only limitation:** ESP32-S3 only supports BLE controllers. Classic Bluetooth controllers (like DualShock 3 in BT mode) will not work. Most modern controllers support BLE.

### Supported Controllers (BLE)

| Controller | Status |
|---|---|
| Xbox One / Series (BLE mode) | Supported |
| 8BitDo controllers (BLE mode) | Supported |
| Switch 2 Pro (BLE) | Supported |
| Generic BLE HID gamepads | Supported |

### Not Supported (Classic BT only)

| Controller | Why |
|---|---|
| DualShock 3 | Classic BT only |
| DualShock 4 | Classic BT only |
| DualSense | Classic BT only |
| Switch Pro | Classic BT only |
| Wii U Pro | Classic BT only |
| Wiimote | Classic BT only |

These controllers pair over Classic BT and require the Pico W build.

## Hardware

### Tested Boards

| Board | Flash | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 | 8MB | Tested | User LED on GPIO 21 (active low) |
| ESP32-S3-DevKitC | Varies | Should work | Untested |

### Why ESP32-S3?

ESP32-S3 is the only ESP32 variant with both BLE and USB OTG:

| Chip | BLE | USB OTG | bt2usb? |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESP32 | Yes (+ Classic) | No | No |
| ESP32-S2 | No | Yes | No |
| **ESP32-S3** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| ESP32-C3/C6/H2 | Yes | No | No |

## Firmware Updates (TinyUF2)

The ESP32-S3 build uses [Adafruit TinyUF2](https://github.com/adafruit/tinyuf2) as a bootloader, enabling the same drag-and-drop `.uf2` firmware updates as RP2040 boards.

### How It Works

TinyUF2 lives in a factory partition on flash. When activated, it presents a USB mass storage drive. Drop a `.uf2` file on the drive and the firmware updates automatically.

```
8MB Flash Layout
────────────────────────────────────────
0x000000  Bootloader (TinyUF2's custom 2nd-stage)
0x008000  Partition table
0x009000  NVS (20KB)
0x00E000  OTA data (8KB) — tells bootloader which app to run
0x010000  ota_0 (2MB) — Joypad firmware lives here
0x210000  ota_1 (2MB) — unused
0x410000  factory (256KB) — TinyUF2 mass storage app
0x450000  ffat (3.7MB) — TinyUF2 virtual FAT filesystem
```

Normal boot: bootloader reads OTA data, boots ota_0 (Joypad app).
TinyUF2 mode: bootloader boots factory partition (TinyUF2), USB drive appears.
Recovery: if ota_0 is corrupted/empty, bootloader falls back to factory (TinyUF2) automatically.

### First-Time Setup

Flash the official TinyUF2 release for your board once. This installs the bootloader, partition table, and TinyUF2:

1. Download the TinyUF2 release for your board from [Adafruit TinyUF2 releases](https://github.com/adafruit/tinyuf2/releases)
   - For XIAO ESP32-S3: `tinyuf2-seeed_xiao_esp32s3-X.XX.X.zip`
2. Extract the zip and flash `combined.bin`:
   ```bash
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -b 921600 write_flash 0x0 combined.bin
   ```
3. The device reboots into TinyUF2 — a USB drive named `XIAOS3BOOT` appears
4. Drop a `.uf2` firmware file onto the drive (or run `make flash-uf2-bt2usb_esp32s3`)

After this one-time setup, all future updates are drag-and-drop.

### Entering TinyUF2 Mode

Three ways to enter TinyUF2 from a running app:

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| Double-tap reset | Press the reset button twice within 500ms |
| CDC command | Send `BOOTSEL` over the USB serial port |
| Recovery | If the app is corrupted, TinyUF2 boots automatically |

### Updating Firmware

**Drag-and-drop (recommended for end users):**

1. Enter TinyUF2 mode (double-tap reset or send `BOOTSEL`)
2. A USB drive appears (`XIAOS3BOOT` on XIAO)
3. Copy the `.uf2` file to the drive
4. Device reboots into the new firmware

**Via make (recommended for development):**

```bash
# Build + flash via TinyUF2 USB drive (device must be in TinyUF2 mode)
make flash-uf2-bt2usb_esp32s3

# Build + flash via esptool USB serial (device must be in download mode)
make flash-bt2usb_esp32s3
```

**Generating .uf2 files:**

```bash
make uf2-bt2usb_esp32s3
# Output: releases/joypad_<version>_bt2usb_esp32s3.uf2
```

## Build & Flash

### Prerequisites

```bash
# One-time setup: install ESP-IDF and tools
make init-esp
```

This clones ESP-IDF v6.0 to `~/esp-idf` and installs the ESP32-S3 toolchain. If you already have ESP-IDF installed, it will skip the clone and just install tools.

### Build Commands

From the repo root:

```bash
make bt2usb_esp32s3                 # Build
make uf2-bt2usb_esp32s3             # Build + generate .uf2
make flash-uf2-bt2usb_esp32s3       # Build + flash .uf2 via TinyUF2 drive
make flash-bt2usb_esp32s3           # Build + flash via esptool
make monitor-bt2usb_esp32s3         # UART serial monitor (Ctrl+] to exit)
```

Or from the `esp/` directory:

```bash
cd esp
source env.sh                       # Activate ESP-IDF environment
make build                          # Build
make uf2                            # Build + generate .uf2
make flash                          # Build + flash via esptool
make monitor                        # UART serial monitor
```

### Board Configurations

Board-specific sdkconfig overrides go in `esp/sdkconfig.board.<name>`:

```bash
echo 'CONFIG_SOME_OPTION=y' > esp/sdkconfig.board.myboard
cd esp && make BOARD=myboard build
```

## Usage

### Pairing

1. Flash the firmware
2. The adapter starts scanning for BLE devices automatically on boot
3. Put your controller into BLE pairing mode
4. Once paired, the controller reconnects automatically on subsequent use

### Button Controls

| Action | Function |
|---|---|
| Click | Start 60-second BLE scan |
| Double-click | Cycle USB output mode |
| Triple-click | Reset to default HID mode |
| Hold | Disconnect all devices and clear bonds |

### Status LED

| LED State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Blinking | No device connected (scanning/idle) |
| Solid on | Device connected |

### USB Output Modes

Double-click the button to cycle through output modes:

```
SInput -> XInput -> PS3 -> PS4 -> Switch -> Keyboard/Mouse -> SInput
```

Triple-click resets to SInput. **DInput is not in the cycle** — `usbd_get_next_mode()`
(`src/usb/usbd/usbd.c`) deliberately skips DInput, PS Classic, Xbox Original, Xbox One and XAC as
less common; reach those over the CDC config interface instead. Each mode change re-enumerates the
board on the USB bus.

### CDC Serial Commands

Connect to the USB serial port for device management:

| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| `VERSION` | Show firmware version |
| `DEVICE` | Show connected controller info |
| `BOOTSEL` | Reboot into TinyUF2 mode |
| `HELP` | List all commands |

## Architecture

### Threading Model

ESP32-S3 uses FreeRTOS with two tasks:

```
Main Task                    BTstack Task
  USB device polling           BLE scanning/pairing
  LED status updates           HID report processing
  Button input                 Controller data -> router
  Storage persistence
```

BTstack runs in its own FreeRTOS task. All BLE operations (scanning, pairing, data) happen in that task. The main task handles USB output, LED, and button input.

### Shared Code

The ESP32-S3 build compiles the same shared source files as the Pico W build:

- Core services (router, players, profiles, hotkeys, storage, LEDs)
- All USB device output modes (HID, XInput, PS3, PS4, Switch, etc.)
- All BT HID drivers (vendor-specific and generic)
- BTstack host integration
- CDC serial command interface

Platform-specific code is abstracted through `src/platform/platform.h`.
