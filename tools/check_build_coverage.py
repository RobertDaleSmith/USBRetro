"""Assert every app build target is either in a CI matrix or explicitly excluded.

Why this exists
---------------
The release is `files: releases/*` over whatever the build matrices produced, so
**matrix membership is release membership** — an app target that is in no matrix
does not exist for users, no matter what the Makefile or the CHANGELOG says.
Nothing enumerated the targets and checked that, so the default outcome for a new
app was silence: as of 2026-08-09, 41 targets had never shipped a UF2, several of
them announced in CHANGELOG.md as shipped features.

`APPS` in the Makefile is not a usable denominator — it is a second
hand-maintained list with its own drift (it omits 21 targets the matrix builds).
The authoritative set is the build targets themselves:

  * pico family  — every `$(call build_app,<target>)` in the Makefile. The matrix
    runs `make <app>` literally, so the target name *is* the build identity and an
    exact name comparison is sound.
  * esp / nrf    — the hand-written recipes in the Makefile. These jobs bypass
    `make` and drive `idf.py` / `west` themselves, so a matrix `app:` value is an
    **artifact name chosen independently of the make target**. Comparing names
    there gives false positives: `bt2usb_xiao_esp32s3` ships as `bt2usb_esp32s3`,
    and `usb2usb_feather_nrf52840` ships as `usb2usb_feather_nrf52840_max3421`.
    Both are covered. So esp/nrf are compared on build *identity* — the
    (board, app) pair — which the Makefile recipe and the matrix entry both state.

Taking the Makefile as the universe leaves one door open, so there is a fourth
check: an app can be added as an `add_executable()` in src/CMakeLists.txt with no
Makefile entry at all. It then has no target to be missing from a matrix, and the
three checks above see nothing — while `make` cannot build it and CI never will.
That is the same end state (an app that ships no UF2) reached from the other side,
so every `joypad_*` executable must be reachable through some APP_/CONSOLE_ pair.

All four of those checks are still rooted in this repo's *top-level* Makefile, so
they share one blind spot: a platform backend that builds itself. `cd wch && make`
has no build_app recipe, no APP_/CONSOLE_ pair and no add_executable to be missing
from anything, so a whole platform can ship nothing while every check above reports
clean. That is not hypothetical — the CH32V307 port landed in June 2026 and was
still invisible in August. Hence a fifth check over the backends themselves.

Those backends are *discovered from the tree*, not listed here. A hardcoded
platform list would be the same hand-maintained-list defect this file exists to
catch: esp and nrf were spelled out in this module, and CH32 arrived without
anything noticing precisely because it was not in that spelling.

Excluding a target is fine; excluding it *silently* is the bug. Anything not in a
matrix must be listed in .github/ci-excluded-apps.txt with a reason.

Exit status: 0 = every target accounted for, 1 = something is unaccounted for.
