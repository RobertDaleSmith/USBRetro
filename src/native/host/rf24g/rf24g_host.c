// rf24g_host.c - SN30 2.4G link state machine, scheduler, pairing
//
// See rf24g_host.h for the public API and sn30_protocol.h for the protocol
// this implements. This file is the third of three layers (rf24g_hal ->
// nrf24l01 -> here) so the protocol logic is testable independently of the
// chip and the chip independently of the board.
//
// ---- Why this is interrupt-driven, not polled ----------------------------
//
// core0_main() (src/main.c) is an unthrottled while(1) running LED, player,
// storage, input, output and app tasks. Any one of them stalling past a
// ~10ms dwell loses a packet -- that stall is exactly what capped the
// ESP8266 reference receiver at 9-10 pkt/s while its Wi-Fi stack ran
// alongside a polled radioPump(). So the radio here runs entirely off
// interrupts:
//
//   - nRF24 IRQ pin, falling edge (on_radio_irq): drains the RX FIFO (3
//     deep, keeps the newest valid frame), decodes it, pushes it to a
//     lock-free ring buffer, waits ACK_GUARD_US for the hardware auto-ACK to
//     clear the antenna, then retunes and re-arms the dwell alarm.
//   - A hardware alarm (on_alarm) fires when a dwell expires with nothing
//     received: advances the index, retunes anyway, counts a miss.
//
// Both handlers -- and everything they call, transitively -- are
// __not_in_flash_func. This is defense in depth, NOT fault avoidance: every
// flash write in this codebase (core/services/storage/flash.c's
// flash_write_page()/flash_erase_sector()) disables core-0 interrupts for
// the entire XIP-off window, so the radio ISR cannot fire mid-write at all
// regardless of where its code lives. __not_in_flash_func here is a second,
// independent guarantee that doesn't depend on that interrupt-disable
// window staying as wide as it is today -- if it were ever narrowed, a
// flash-resident handler pulled in mid-erase would hard-fault immediately
// instead of working by accident. (The ISR entry path itself --
// ram_vector_table's flash-resident dispatchers before control reaches this
// file's RAM trampolines in rf24g_hal_rp2040.c -- is not fully RAM-resident
// regardless; that's accepted for the same reason: interrupts are off, so
// it can't execute mid-write either.)
//
// The real, non-hypothetical cost of a flash write while the controller is
// linked: interrupts off for a ~4KB sector erase (~45ms, flash_erase_sector())
// costs roughly 3-9 missed dwells at the 10070us DWELL_US period. MAX_MISSES
// is 128 (~1.29s) before the link is considered dropped, and every received
// frame re-syncs both hop index and phase (see handle_frame()), so the link
// rides out an erase without dropping.
//
// __not_in_flash_func places a function's OWN code in RAM; it does nothing
// for functions it calls, so the attribute has to be repeated all the way
// down the call chain (this file, nrf24l01.c, rf24g_hal_rp2040.c). Anything
// NOT reachable from the ISR/alarm chain (init, the public task/stats/pairing
// entry points called from ordinary core-0 code) is free to live in flash
// and use platform_time_us()/platform_time_ms() normally.
//
// rf24g_host_task(), called from core 0, does NO radio I/O at all -- it only
// drains the ring buffer, builds input_event_t's and calls
// router_submit_input(), plus the non-timing-critical pairing-confirmation
// and per-second stats bookkeeping.

// looks more rigorous but is wrong -- it averages in pairs that span a

// seeded with this constant and then refined the same restricted way -- see

// it on the wrong channel -- and the controller is waiting on exactly that
// ACK before it will start hopping. Measured plateau across 0-500us with a
// real nRF24L01+ (unlike the OEM dongle's slow bit-banged SPI, which never
// gets there fast enough to matter); kept at the value everything else was
// tuned around.
